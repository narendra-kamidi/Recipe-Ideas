# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Recipe Ideas 🍽️

Recipe Ideas is a simple and user-friendly **React web app** that helps you discover delicious meals based on the ingredients you already have, your cravings, or the time you want to spend cooking.  
It uses the free [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) to fetch and display recipes dynamically.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Search by Ingredient:** Enter any ingredient (e.g., chicken, pasta) to get recipe ideas.
- 📋 **Detailed Recipes:** View meal details with cooking instructions and ingredients.
- 🥗 **Filter Options:** Customize your meal search based on dietary preferences.
- 🖥️ **Responsive UI:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile.
- 🎨 **Clean and Modern Design:** Easy-to-navigate interface built with React.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript, JSX, CSS)
- **API:** [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/)
- **Styling:** CSS / Flexbox / Grid
- **Package Manager:** npm

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User enters an ingredient in the search bar.
2. The app queries TheMealDB API:
3. Recipes matching that ingredient are displayed with images.
4. Clicking a recipe shows detailed instructions.
