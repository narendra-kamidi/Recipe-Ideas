# Recipe Ideas 🍽️

Recipe Ideas is a simple and user-friendly **React web app** that helps you discover delicious meals based on the ingredients you already have, your cravings, or the time you want to spend cooking.  
It uses the free [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) to fetch and display recipes dynamically.
